Hi !
  
I am Siddharth Bhatt. I am a full stack developer.

I graduated from [Symbiosis International University](http://siu.edu.in/) in 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications.

I work as iOS Engineer at [leftshift.io](http://leftshift.io/)

I love clean and minimalistic design.

I love C, Objective-C, Swift, Python.

I hate Java. Don’t ask why.

If you also believe [NFS:MW(2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_%282005_video_game%29) was the best NFS ever made, [high five](https://www.campuspride.org/wp-content/uploads/3db1d0f.jpg) !
