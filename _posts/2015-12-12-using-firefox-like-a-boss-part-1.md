YES.

Add-ons !

### So Lets get started !
Add-ons for firefox make it the best browser in terms of customisability, there are add-ons for almost anything you need. We are going to cover some basic add-ons which convert a normal user into a smart user.

#### What are Add-ons exactly ?
Add-ons are little pieces of javascript code that run inside your browser to get a particular task done (e.g. hide a specific element on a webpage). Add-ons do not have a life outside your browser. Web Apps (such as those downloaded from firefox marketplace) ARE NOT Add-ons; Although they also need to access the core browser functionalities to to run but they can function separately from the rest of the browser.

#### Where to get them from ?
To access Add-ons in your firefox, you can go to   
Tools Menu -> Add-ons   

or via typing this in your address bar : `about:addons`

or alternatively, you can browse, download and install add-ons for firefox directly from :
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)<br>
The URL above may change according to your language.  
  
Some third-party websites also allow users to download and install add-ons from their sites. You should only install such add-ons if the third-party vendor is a trusted entity.
